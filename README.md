# smart-lp-gas-monitoring-system-with-gas-detection-system
 I developed an innovative Smart LP Gas Monitoring System tailored for domestic users. Leveraging the powerful ESP32 development board as the central control unit, this system provides real-time monitoring of gas levels and prompt detection of potential leaks, ensuring safety and peace of mind for households. 
Key Features:

Gas Level Monitoring: The system utilizes a Load Cell and HX711 AC to DC Converter to accurately measure LP gas levels. This data is then displayed in real-time on an LCD Display, allowing users to track their gas consumption conveniently.

Leakage Detection: Safety is paramount, which is why I incorporated an MQ2 Gas Sensor into the system. This sensor is capable of swiftly detecting any gas leaks, triggering immediate notifications to users via the Blynk IoT app.

Arduino IDE Programming: The entire system is programmed using the Arduino IDE, ensuring ease of development and customization. This approach allows for seamless integration of various sensors and modules to meet specific user requirements.

IoT Integration with Blynk: By integrating the Blynk IoT app, users can remotely monitor gas levels and receive instant notifications on their smartphones in case of any abnormalities. This feature enhances user convenience and enables proactive management of gas usage and safety.

Main Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to provide domestic users with an advanced yet user-friendly solution for LP gas monitoring and leakage detection. By offering real-time data visualization and immediate alerts, the system empowers users to take timely actions to prevent potential hazards and ensure the safety of their homes and families.
